Upon completing the game, players will be confronted with a thought-provoking question: is victory achieved by attaining the highest score or by pursuing the lowest?

## Mechanics

### Player

The players will have control over a character throughout the game, providing them with the following abilities:

- **Movement**: Players can move with an 8-direction movement across any of the scenes. The movement system incorporates acceleration and deceleration curves to enhance the fluidity of motion. Obstacles such as walls or furniture will restrict movement, encouraging players to strategize their movements carefully to avoid becoming trapped. Further details about objects and their impact on movement will be covered in the Level Design section.
- **Aiming**: Players can rotate their character to aim in various directions. The rotation will be smoothed through linear interpolation to enhance the overall responsiveness of movement.
- **Attack**: With the press of a button, Players can perform an attack, this will be explained with more detail on the _Weapon System_ part.
- **Change weapons**: Players are able to hold up to two weapons at the same time and change between them during gameplay. However, switching weapons takes time, making it unwise to do so during combat. Players may also **throw a weapon** to free up a slot and pick up a different weapon from the ground. Throwing a weapon at an enemy will briefly stun them, rendering them unable to move or attack for a short period.
