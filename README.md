# Project conventions

## File structure conventions

Project files are structured by object rather than by type. Example of a project structure:
```
|-- Project Name
    |-- Assets
        |-- Art
        |   |-- Industrial
        |   |   |-- Ambient
        |   |   |-- Machinery
        |   |   |-- Pipes
        |   |-- Nature
        |   |   |-- Ambient
        |   |   |-- Foliage
        |   |   |-- Rocks
        |   |   |-- Trees
        |   |-- Office
        |-- Characters

        |   |-- Common
        |   |   |-- Animations
        |   |   |-- Audio
        |   |-- Jack
        |   |-- Steve
        |   |-- Zoe
        |-- Core
        |   |-- Characters
        |   |-- Engine
        |   |-- GameModes
        |   |-- Interactables
        |   |-- Pickups
        |   |-- Weapons
        |-- Effects
        |   |-- Electrical
        |   |-- Fire
        |   |-- Weather

        |   |-- Debug
        |   |-- Metal
        |   |-- Paint
        |   |-- Utility
        |   |-- Weathering
        |-- Placeables
        |   |-- Pickups
        |-- Weapons
            |-- Common
            |-- Pistols

## Coding conventions

Public variables **MUST** be named with PascalCase. Private variables **MUST** be named using `camelCase`, putting a `_` prefix on Non Serialized private variables

Constant are named using `SCREAMING_CASE`

Functions, classes and GetSet variables are named using `PascalCase` and **MUST** have proper documentation with parameters and returns (if not void). Not having documentation with result on the dismission of a pull request

When using `Debug.Log("message");`, a variable must be declared so it can be turn on or off. You **MUST** provide the name of the script that is calling the function. Warnings and errors don't need to have a variable to disable them as they are critical for development.
Variable **MUST** be declared like this: 
```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR
[Header("Debug")]
[SerializeField] private bool log = false;
#endif

// Example of Log
#if UNITY_EDITOR
if (log) Debug.Log($"{this.name}: message");
#endif
```
Remember to put debug staff on compiler IFs so they aren't included on build

## Git repository

Do **NOT** commit on main without an aproved PR

Create feature branches for the group of issues you are working on and link them to the branch

When creating an issue provide a description and select a tag and a milestone for it
